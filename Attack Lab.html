									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Attack Lab consists of five phases, each unique and more difficult to create an attack progressively. Attack Lab is a very complex project and difficult to understand at first but to give you an idea of what Attack Lab actually is, I'll be going over phase five (the hardest phase of them all and arguably more difficult than Bomb Lab). </p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Context</h2>
									<p>To create an attack for this phase, some of the solution was built during the process of reaching phase five, so for this phase we're given our buffer (56 bytes of zeroes), our cookie address (0x55e61a88), and address of Touch Three function (0x40187e). Our solution for this phase is:</p>
									<p>Buffer</p>
									<p>Gadget One (%rsp -> %rax)</p>
									<p>Gadget Two (%rax -> %rdi)</p>
									<p>Pop Byte for %rax</p>
									<p>Row of Zeroes</p>
									<p>New Address of %eax -> %esi</p>
									<p>Address of add_xy</p>
									<p>Gadget Two (%rax -> %rdi)</p>
									<p>Touch Three Function Address</p>
									<p>Cookie Address as a String</p>
									<hr/>

									<h2>Encoding Instructions</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Enc.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We are given a set of encoding instructions that will help us find our addresses to create an attack.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Gadget One</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/g1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>First, we look at the bytes that %rsp points to at %rax and we can see it's "48 89 e0."</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/g1a.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is snippet from the assembly function "start_farm" where we've found the bytes "48 89 e0" (highlighted in pink). We can see that these bytes were found at the address 4019cb, however we must also consider the offset which is two (highlighted in green). Therefore our address for gadget one is 0x4019cd because 0x4019cb + 0x2 = 0x4019cd.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Gadget Two</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/g2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We have to see what're the bytes that %rax points to at %rdi and we can see it's "48 89 c7."</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/g2a.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Here we've found the bytes "48 89 c7" (highlighted in blue) but notice that there are four of the same bytes in different addresses to choose from. In our case we're only focused on the bytes that're followed by "c3" first for "return." Therefore the address we're looking at is 40190c and considering the offset of two, our address for gadget two is 0x40190e because 0x40190c + 0x2 = 0x40190e.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Pop byte for %rax</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/p.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We pop %rax and see that the byte we're looking for is "58".</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pa.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Here we've found the byte "58" (highlighted in pink) is at the address 401935 with an offset of five. Our address for popping %rax is 0x40193a because 0x401935 + 0x5 = 0x40193a.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>New Address for %eax -> %esi</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/axsi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We're supposed to be looking at the bytes that %eax points to at %esi however they're not to be found in the assembly dump. To resolve this issue, we must look through %esi's column and see what other registers can get to %esi while still traveling through %eax. The register, %ecx, is an option that worked for this attack.</p>
									
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cxsi.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We're looking for bytes "89 ce" and have found them at this address followed after bytes "20 c0". </p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/m1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is okay because bytes "20 c0" are NOP's (not operational) instructions as seen below.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/n1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The new address that %ecx points to at %esi is 0x4019f5 + 0x1 (offset) = 0x4019f6. At this point we'd check to see if %eax can be passed into %ecx to get to %esi, but unfortunately this isn't the case. The next register that worked for this attack is %edx.</p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/dxcx.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We're looking for bytes "89 d1" and have found them at this address followed after bytes "20 db". </p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/m2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is okay because bytes "20 db" are NOP's (not operational) instructions as seen below.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/n3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The new address that %edx points to at %ecx is 0x40198a + 0x1 (offset) = 0x40198b. We can check to see if %eax can be passed into %edx to get to %esi and this time it's possible.</p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/axdx.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We're looking for bytes "89 c2" and have found them at this address followed after bytes "20 c9". </p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/m3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is okay because bytes "20 c9" are NOP's (not operational) instructions as seen below.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/n2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The new address that %eax points to at %edx is 0x4019a4 + 0x2 (offset) = 0x4019a6. We now have registers that pass %eax -> %esi through %eax -> %edx -> %ecx -> %esi.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Address of "add_xy"</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/add_xy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The address is 0x401948.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>Cookie Address as a String</h2>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cookie.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We use the Ascii Table to convert each character into hexadecimals to become a single string. The address of our cookie (0x55e61a88) is "35 35 65 36 31 61 38 38" as a string.</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>ROP Attack</h2>
									<p>We now have all the sufficient information to create our ROP attack:</p>
									
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>cd 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>0e 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>3a 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>a6 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>8b 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>f6 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>48 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>0e 19 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>7e 18 40 00 00 00 00 00</p>
									<p>35 35 65 36 31 61 38 38</p>
									<hr/>
									<h2>But what about the extra row of zeroes?</h2>
									<p>That is actually our own buffer for our optcodes. So we need to have enough space for the empty row to the touch 3 address. In this case there are only 6 rows of 8 bits so 48 bits of space. Hence, the FINAL solution is the following below. (You may have noticed that my addresses are written backwords. This is because of a concept called "Little Endianness" in which the least significant bit (or "littlest" end) is first stored at address 0, and subsequent bits are stored incrementally.)</p>
